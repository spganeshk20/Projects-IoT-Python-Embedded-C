End-to-End(E2E) solution projects developed using the below following programming languages and concepts, Hardware platform and cloud platforms

Programming languages - Python2.7, Python-Flask Web Framework

Hardware platform - Raspberry PI

Cloud platform - Thingspeak

# Hardware list
	1. Ultrasonic sensor (SR)
	2. LED
	3. PIR sensor
	4. Thingspeak cloud access

# Quick configuration note

	1. It is very quick and ease to reconfigure to any raspberry pi board pin connection.
	2. Designed in a modularised way. The solution is developed for thingspeak cloud

# Steps to configure the file
	1. To deploy the code on any raspberry pi board (use GPIO board configuration setup mode)
	2. Edit config.py file parameter values (pin values and thingspeak cloud values)
	3. Run sensor_app.py file on your raspberry pi board
	4. Run web_app.py in local system (install flask python package)

# Project tracking procedure

	1. Fork this project into your repository and start working on it
	2. Do not forget to click the github repository watch button to receive the regular code update mail notification
